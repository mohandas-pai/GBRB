    <string name="content">A word has been selected at random - can you guess it in 10? How about 7?\n\n
        The hardest part of this game is not screaming at the game when you loose (especially when you were so close!)\n\n
        How to play:\n\n
        1.Make a guess at the 4-letter word\n
        2.If your guess has any matching letters with the selected word you will be told how many\n
        3.The green box next to your guess will tell you how many letters match and are in the correct position\n
        4.The red box will tell you if any letters match but are not in the correct position\n
        5.On your next guess you will try and figure out which letters are correct and which are not\n
        6.Guess wisely, you only have 10 guesses (7 guesses on hard mode)/n/n
        Try to maintain your streak!\n\n
