A mind game where the person has to guess the word generated by the computer.


The app is published in play store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moh.theamazingappco.bricks

Note: The build version of this app is outdated because i cant update it on my PC due to space constraints, i will soon update the sdk version.

Issues I need help with:

1) A nice splash screen to go with the game.
2) Logo for the game might need some improvement.
3) The general UI changes that can be made, I am happy to accept.
4) The UI for lobby activity can be improved a lot.
